## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Complexity Overload**
   - Risk: System becomes too complex to maintain and debug
   - Mitigation: Implement modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, and documentation

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Risk: Code analysis and context building become too slow for large projects
   - Mitigation: Implement intelligent caching, lazy loading, and configurable depth limits

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Risk: Large codebases consume excessive memory during analysis
   - Mitigation: Implement streaming analysis, context compaction, and memory monitoring

4. **Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Integrating multiple parsers and analysis tools creates maintenance burden
   - Mitigation: Use well-established libraries, implement adapter patterns, and maintain compatibility matrices

5. **Configuration Complexity**
   - Risk: Configuration system becomes too complex for users
   - Mitigation: Provide sensible defaults, configuration templates, and validation with helpful error messages

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Incremental Enhancement**: Gradually improve existing agent while adding Forge-inspired features
   - Pros: Lower risk, maintains backward compatibility
   - Cons: May not achieve the full potential of Forge-style architecture

2. **Hybrid Architecture**: Keep existing tool system but implement Forge-style reasoning and context management
   - Pros: Balances innovation with stability
   - Cons: May create architectural inconsistencies

3. **Complete Rewrite**: Start from scratch with pure Forge architecture translation
   - Pros: Clean architecture, full feature parity potential
   - Cons: High risk, significant development time, potential compatibility issues
