# Agentic Visaire CLI Transformation

## Objective
Transform the existing visaire CLI from a simple LLM query tool into a fully agentic CLI that can reason about user requests and execute actions using built-in tools. The agent will be capable of file system operations, shell command execution, package installation, and maintaining conversation context while preserving the existing authentication and provider system.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation and Architecture

1. **Extend Package Dependencies**
   - Dependencies: None
   - Notes: Add fs-extra for enhanced file operations, inquirer for user prompts, and other required packages
   - Files: package.json
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Create Agent Core Architecture**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Implement main agent reasoning engine that can parse LLM responses and determine actionable steps
   - Files: lib/agent.js (new)
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Implement Tool System Foundation**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Create modular tool registry with filesystem, shell execution, and package management capabilities
   - Files: lib/tools/index.js (new), lib/tools/filesystem.js (new), lib/tools/exec.js (new), lib/tools/npm.js (new)
   - Status: Not Started

4. **Create Logger and History System**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Implement conversation logging and agent action tracking with .visaire directory structure
   - Files: lib/logger.js (new)
   - Status: Not Started

### Phase 2: Core Agent Features

5. **Implement LLM Response Parsing**
   - Dependencies: Task 2
   - Notes: Add intelligent action detection from natural language responses with fallback to structured output where available
   - Files: lib/agent.js, lib/providers.js
   - Status: Not Started

6. **Build User Confirmation System**
   - Dependencies: Task 2
   - Notes: Interactive confirmation prompts for destructive operations with trust mode options
   - Files: lib/agent.js
   - Status: Not Started

7. **Integrate Tools with Agent**
   - Dependencies: Task 3, Task 5
   - Notes: Connect tool execution framework with agent reasoning and error handling
   - Files: lib/agent.js, lib/tools/index.js
   - Status: Not Started

8. **Extend Configuration System**
   - Dependencies: Task 4
   - Notes: Add agent-specific settings including trust levels, tool permissions, and default behaviors
   - Files: lib/config.js
   - Status: Not Started

### Phase 3: CLI Integration

9. **Update Main CLI Interface**
   - Dependencies: Task 2, Task 8
   - Notes: Integrate agent mode into existing CLI while maintaining backward compatibility
   - Files: bin/visaire.js
   - Status: Not Started

10. **Add Configuration Commands**
    - Dependencies: Task 8, Task 9
    - Notes: Implement visaire config set command for easy setup of API keys, providers, and agent settings
    - Files: bin/visaire.js, lib/config.js
    - Status: Not Started

11. **Enhance Output and Feedback**
    - Dependencies: Task 4, Task 9
    - Notes: Improve user feedback with real-time agent status, tool execution logs, and progress indicators
    - Files: lib/utils.js
    - Status: Not Started

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

12. **Create Comprehensive Tests**
    - Dependencies: Task 7, Task 10
    - Notes: Unit tests for agent reasoning, tool execution, and integration tests for complete workflows
    - Files: test/agent.test.js (new), test/tools.test.js (new), test/config.test.js
    - Status: Not Started

13. **Update Documentation**
    - Dependencies: Task 11, Task 12
    - Notes: Comprehensive documentation update including agentic features, security considerations, and usage examples
    - Files: README.md
    - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria

- Agent successfully parses user prompts and identifies actionable tasks
- File system operations (create, read, update, delete) work reliably with proper permissions
- Shell command execution is secure and provides appropriate user feedback
- User confirmation system prevents unintended destructive actions
- Configuration system allows easy setup of API keys and agent preferences
- All existing CLI functionality remains intact and backward compatible
- Conversation history and agent actions are properly logged
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new features
- Security measures prevent unauthorized file access or command execution

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **LLM Response Parsing Reliability**
   Mitigation: Implement hybrid approach with structured output for supported providers and robust natural language parsing with confidence scoring for others

2. **Security and Permission Management**
   Mitigation: Implement multi-layer security with user confirmation prompts, file system sandboxing options, and command whitelist/blacklist capabilities

3. **State Management Complexity**
   Mitigation: Design clear session boundaries with persistent context storage and recovery mechanisms for interrupted operations

4. **Tool Execution Error Handling**
   Mitigation: Implement comprehensive error recovery with rollback capabilities and detailed error reporting to both user and logs

5. **Configuration System Complexity**
   Mitigation: Extend existing robust configuration system incrementally while maintaining backward compatibility and providing migration paths

6. **Performance Impact of Agent Processing**
   Mitigation: Optimize agent reasoning pipeline and provide options to disable agentic features for simple query use cases

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Function Calling First**: Start with OpenAI function calling for reliable action detection, then extend to other providers with natural language parsing
2. **Plugin Architecture**: Implement tools as plugins with a registry system for easier extensibility and third-party tool integration
3. **Separate Agent Mode**: Create distinct agent and query modes instead of unified interface to reduce complexity and maintain clear separation of concerns
4. **Web Interface Integration**: Add optional web UI for complex agent interactions while maintaining CLI-first approach
5. **Docker Integration**: Package agent with containerized execution environment for enhanced security and isolation
